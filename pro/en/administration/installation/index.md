% Installation

Two installation methods are supported:

* System package: RPM and Debian packaging is intended for managed installation and provides
  robust tools that integrate with your environment, man pages, shell
  tool set in your path, init.d startup and shutdown.
  
* Launcher: The launcher is intended for quick setup, to get you
  running right away.  Perfect for bootstrapping a project or trying
  a new feature.  

Rundeck can also install as a WAR file into an external container like Tomcat.


Assuming the system requirements are met, Rundeck can be installed
either from source, system package or via the launcher.
