% Configuring Plugins

## Overview

Most of what Rundeck does is via one of its plugins. 
Several [plugin types](plugin-types.html) exist
to [execute commands on nodes][page:administration/configuration/plugins/configuring.md#node-execution], 
perform a step in a workflow, 
send a notification about job status, gather
[information about the hosts][page:administration/configuration/plugins/configuring.md#resource-model-sources] 
in your network, copy a file to a remote
server, store and stream logs, or talk to a user directory.

See the [Plugin Developer Guide](../../../developer/index.html) if you are interested in creating one of your own plugins.
