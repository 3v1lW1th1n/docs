.SH NAME
.PP
rdq - execute commands across nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
rdq [\f[I]action\f[]] [-h] [-e]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The rdq command is used to query the Central Dispatcher for a list
of currently running Executions, or to Kill a currently running
execution.
.PP
The tool provides two actions:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]list\f[] : list the currently running executions on the server
(default action)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]kill\f[] : kill the execution specified by ID
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-h, --help : Print usage message.
.PP
-e, --eid : ID of the execution to kill
.SH LIST ACTION
.PP
This is the default action of the tool, so to list all running
Executions, simply use:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
rdq
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The output will display the number of executions, and their IDs and
identifying names or descriptions, as well as a link to the RunDeck
page to follow the output.
