This chapter helps new users get started with Rundeck. We will begin
by explaining a few essential Rundeck concepts and
terminology and then discuss installation, project setup and introduce
you to the top level navigation of the interface.

## Essential Concepts

Several fundamental concepts underly and drive the Rundeck system. 
If you are a new user, knowing about them will
help you use or integrate Rundeck into your environment.

Role-based Access Control Policies

:   A Rundeck *access control policy* grants users
	and user groups certain
    privileges to perform actions against rundeck resources
    like projects, jobs, nodes, commands and API.
    Every action requested by a user is evaulated by the
    Rundeck authorization system and logged for 
    reporting and auditing purposes.

    Since Rundeck respects the policy definition, you can define role-based
    authorization to restrict users to only a subset of actions. This
    enables a self-service type interface, where some users have
    access to a limited set of executable actions.

Projects

:   A *project* is a place to separate management activity.
    All Rundeck activities occur within the context of a project.
    Multiple projects can be maintained on the same Rundeck server.
    Projects are independent from one another, so you can use them to
    organize unrelated systems within a single Rundeck
    installation. This can be useful for managing different infrastructures,
    environments or applications.
    Projects can be archived and imported to other Rundeck servers to help
    promote changes between environments.


Jobs

:   *Jobs* encapsulate a sequence of steps, job options and
    a nodes where the steps execute.
    Jobs can be given a unique
    ID, a name, and group to organize them. Jobs can be
    run on demand or they may be scheduled to run periodically.
    Jobs can send notifications when they begin, succeed or fail.
    Jobs take a number of parameters to control execution, including
    what to do when an error occurs in one of the steps or
    how many threads to execute actions across a list of nodes.

    Jobs can be composed out of other jobs. Each job can be a step
    in another job sequence. 

Nodes

:   A _Node_  is a resource that is either a physical or virtual instance
    of a network accessible host.
    Nodes have a number of basic attributes but these attributes can be
    extended to include arbitrary named key/value pairs. 
    A *node filter* is a search expression that matches a set of nodes
    by their attributes. Rundeck  node filters let you match Nodes based on a pattern like "tags" or any node attribute.
 
    A *resource model* is a representation of Nodes in a project.
    Each project can be configured to have multiple resource model sources
    and each model source can contribute its own set of nodes and node attributes.


Commands

:   A _command_ is a single executable string executed on a Node.
    Rundeck invokes commands on nodes via a *node executor*
    which evaluates the command string and executes it. 
    Node executors evaluate the command string in a data context
    containing information about the Node resource. Command strings
    can reference this data and thus avoid hard coding node or environment
    specific values.

Executions

:   An _execution_ is a representation of the activity of a running or completed 
    command or job. The data about the execution is used in rundeck to monitor
    the progress of a job or command and later for reporting about what happened.

    Each execution contains any output generated by commands or job steps,
    a record of the nodes where they occurred and the start/end time and status
    for each step.

Plugins

:   Most of what Rundeck does is via one of its plugins. Plugins exist
    to execute commands on nodes, perform a step in a workflow, 
    send a notification about job status, gather
    information about the hosts in your network, copy a file to a remote
    server, store and stream logs, or talk to a user directory.
    A *node executor* is a Rundeck plugin that implements how to
    communicate with the Node and how to invoke the command action.

## Download and Installation

If a running Rundeck instance isn't already available to you, 
[download](http://rundeck.org/downloads.html) and 
install it. There are several package formats. 
Choose the one that best suits your infrastructure.

After installation, be sure Rundeck has been started.
See [Startup](../administration/startup-and-shutdown.html) to learn how to
startup and shutdown rundeck.

The default port for the web interface is `4440`. If you
installed Rundeck on your local machine, go to this URL: <http://localhost:4440>

## Login

Rundeck requires every user to login. The default installation
defines an "admin" user with access to perform all actions.
Use "admin" for username and password.

## Project setup

A new installation will not contain any projects so Rundeck will present
you with a dialog to create one. Press the "New Project" button to create
a project. 
Fill the project creation form with a desired name. Project names can
contain letters and numbers but do not use spaces or special characters.
The [Project setup](../administration/project-setup.html) 
chapter in the Administrator guide
will show you how to learn to add Nodes, automate the creation and maintenance of
Rundeck projects.

Once the project has been created you are ready to use your Rundeck instance.

## Rundeck Graphical Console


### Navigation

The Rundeck page header contains global navigation control to move
between tabbed pages: Jobs, Nodes, Commands and Activity. It also has links to
Configure the project, logout, view your user profile and a link to this online help.

![Top navigation bar](../figures/fig0201.png)

Project menu

:    The top navigation bar contains a menu to select the
     desired project. If only one project exists, the menu will
     automatically be selected. You can create new projects from
     this menu, too.
   
Jobs

:    From the Jobs page, one can list, create and run Jobs. A
     configurable filter allows a user to limit the Job listing to those
     Jobs matching the filtering criteria. These filter settings can be
     saved to a Users profile. Only authorized jobs will be visible.
     
     See [Jobs](jobs.html).

Nodes

:    The Nodes page is used to browse your Nodes configured in your
     Project resource model. A filter  control can be used to 
     limit the listing to just the Node resources
     matching the filter criteria. Given the appropriate authorization
     you can also execute ad hoc commands to your filtered node set.
     
     See [Nodes](nodes.html).

Commands

:    The Commands page lets you execute abitrary commands against the
     nodes that match the node filter.
     
     See [Commands](commands.html).

Activity

:    From the Activity page, one can view currently executing commands
     and Jobs or browse execution history. The execution
     history can be filtered based on user selected parameters. Once the
     filter has been set, the matching history is displayed. The current
     filter settings also configure an RSS link, found in the top right of
     the page (see Rundeck Administration to enable RSS). 
     
     See [Activity](activity.html).

  
Configure

:    If your login belongs to the "admin" group and therefore granted
     "admin" privileges, a "Configure" icon will be displayed in
     the top navigation bar. 
     From the Configure page you can edit project configuration,
     export and import project archives, view system information,
     and see what plugins are installed.
     
     See [Configure](configure.html)

User

:    The User menu lets you logout and view your profile page. 
     Your user profile lists your group memberships and a form to list
     and generate API tokens.
     
     See [User](user.html)

Help

:    Opens a page to this user manual.


## Command Line Tools 

Rundeck includes a number of shell tools to dispatch commands, load
and run Job definitions and interact with the dispatcher queue. These
command tools are an alternative to functions accessible in the
graphical console.

See the [Command line tools](../man1/index.html).

## API

You can also use the Web API to interface with all aspects of node
and Job execution. 

See the [Rundeck API](../api/index.html) page for a reference on the
endpoints and examples.

## Document Formats

If you prefer to manage job and resource definitions using text files
you can do so using XML or YAML formats.

See the [Document Format Reference](../man5/index.html).
