# Introduction #

## What is this guide about?

Welcome to the RunDeck user guide. This guide was written to help
administrators quickly become productive with the RunDeck server. 

RunDeck is open source software that helps administrators automate
ad-hoc and routine procedures.  RunDeck provides a number of features
that help you scale your scripting in a distributed environment for
multi-step procedures. RunDeck helps alleviate time-consuming grunt
work that comes from managing many systems in a dynamic environment.

### Who makes the RunDeck software?

RunDeck is hosted at GitHub as a project called
[dtolabs/rundeck](https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck).
Dtolabs is a project where various open sources tools are
being developed by [DTO Solutions](http://www.dtosolutions.com)
engineers working in the field.

RunDeck is free software and is public under the Apache Software License.

### Why is RunDeck open source?

We believe this kind of software project must be open source because
it is a new technology space and therefore ideas and code should be
easily transferable.

### Why is it called RunDeck

## RunDeck from 30,000 feet

### RunDeck in the tool chain

### RunDeck architecture
